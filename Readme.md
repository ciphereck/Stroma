## Description  
  
Stroma is a simple web browser extension cum android application that provides a much better privacy by locking individual web browser tabs or individual URLs.  
  
It provides security against cyber theft where a person (your friend / relative) who borrowed your laptop for a while, gain access to certain URLs or tabs in tab strip or already logged accounts. It also provides flexibility in locking tabs on owner's discretion and can be unlocked by a proving identity.

There's also an android app where you can maintain all tabs that are there in the web browser, see status whether they are locked or not, and lock individual URLs from android app directly irrespective of whether they are in tabs strip or not.

When one gives laptop to his/her aquinatance, he/she can start locking session after which all the tabs which are in should be locked list get locked. This can also be done from android directly.
